# Pong
This is an implementation of the ever-popular arcade game, Pong, using the crossroads between HTML and JavaScript. It was originally made my Allan Alcorn in 1972 at Atari. Ironically, it was originally assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell as a training exercise! In this game, the user has a paddle and a ball in the middle. The user must use the up and down arrows on their keyboard to give the corresponding movement to the paddle. Some versions require two players to play the game, but this version is made for only one player with the other player being an A.I (Artificial Intelligence) bot. Feel free to click on the given link in this repository to see a live demo of the game and make any suggestions!
